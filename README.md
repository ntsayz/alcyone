# Untitled Project
## 2D Rigid Body Movement In a Vacuum

This is a side project being currently developed, trying to use the knowledge obtained in a class of [Dynamics and Dynamical Systems](https://villate.org/dynamics/index.html), during my 2nd Year of University at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.inicial). With the main objective of simulating what would be a movement of a body in a vacuum, compling with all Newton's Laws of Motion.

### TO-DO
- Particles (Creating thrust and therefore justifying the ship's movement)
- Rocket/Bullet (Should would affect the ship's momentum)
- Planets (Should have a slight gravitational pull and it should thus affect the ship's trajectory)
